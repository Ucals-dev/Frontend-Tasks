# Frontend-Tasks

This github repo contains all tasks for the FronEnd class for Lucas BUTERY.

For each project, npm install (or another way like yarn ...) must be do first.

For the todo List using angular:
- **node server.js** starts the backend but also render the todo list. This backend is then used for the other 2 todo lists.
If the server is not listening to **localhost:4000**, the todo lists won't work.

-For each other project, **npm run dev** allow the start of the app (but obivously you can use other tools or also build before)
