# Frontend-Tasks

This github repo contains all tasks for the FronEnd class for Lucas BUTERY.

For each project, **npm install** (or another way like yarn ...) must be do first.

For the todo List using angular:
- **node server.js** starts the backend but also render the todo list. This backend is then used for the other 2 todo lists. If the server is not listening to **localhost:4000**, the todo lists won't work.

- To start the svelte to do list, among others, **npm run dev** can be used

- To start the react to do list, **npm start**

- Finally, to start the layout-task that i decided to do with react, **npm start** . For this task, I choose the 5th layout.
